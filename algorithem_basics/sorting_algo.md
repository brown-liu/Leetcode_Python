#Sorting
reason for sorting:
* Searching for a specific value v in array A,
* Finding the min/max or the k-th smallest/largest value in (static) array A,
* Testing for uniqueness and deleting duplicates in array A,
* Counting how many time a specific value v appear in array A,
* Set intersection/union between array A and another sorted array B,
* Finding a target pair x ∈ A and y ∈ A such that x+y equals to a target z, etc

method: 

iterative (check every single item in list,from start to end) <br>
recursive (output of a function as input of same question)<br>

###Comparison-based Sorting Algorithms:
1. BUB - Bubble Sort,**Compare left and right. deal with only two element at a time. and loop around the whole list**
2. SEL - Selection Sort **Compare one element with the rest in the list, find the smallest one and move to front side**
3. INS - Insertion Sort
4. MER - Merge Sort (recursive implementation)
5. QUI - Quick Sort (recursive implementation)
6. R-Q - Random Quick Sort (recursive implementation).

###Not Comparison-based Sorting Algorithms:
-COU - Counting Sort,
-RAD - Radix Sort.
